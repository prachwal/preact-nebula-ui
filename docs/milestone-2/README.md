- [x] Accessibility compliant (semantic HTML, ARIA)
- [x] Interactive demo pages with real-world examples
- [x] Performance optimized for complex layouts
- [x] TypeScript fully typed with comprehensive interfaces
- [x] Dark mode support throughout

## 🏗️ Layout System Architecture

### Responsive Design Philosophy
- **Mobile-first**: Start with mobile and enhance for larger screens
- **Flexible Units**: Use relative units (rem, %, fr) over fixed pixels
- **Breakpoint System**: Consistent breakpoints across all components
- **Content-driven**: Layout adapts to content rather than forcing content into layout

### Composition Patterns
```typescript
// Example of composable layout structure
<Container size="lg" padding="lg">
  <Stack direction="vertical" spacing="lg">
    <Card variant="elevated">
      <Card.Header>
        <h2>Dashboard Overview</h2>
      </Card.Header>
      <Card.Body>
        <Stack direction="horizontal" spacing="md" align="center">
          <div>Content area</div>
          <Divider orientation="vertical" />
          <div>Sidebar content</div>
        </Stack>
      </Card.Body>
      <Card.Footer>
        <Stack direction="horizontal" spacing="sm" justify="end">
          <Button variant="outline">Cancel</Button>
          <Button variant="primary">Save</Button>
        </Stack>
      </Card.Footer>
    </Card>
  </Stack>
</Container>
```

## 🚀 Impact & Foundation

This milestone established critical layout capabilities that enabled:

### Complex UI Patterns
- Dashboard layouts with multiple content areas
- Form layouts with proper spacing and alignment
- Content cards with consistent visual hierarchy
- Responsive navigation and content structures

### Design System Consistency
- Standardized spacing scale across all components
- Consistent visual elevation and depth
- Unified responsive behavior patterns
- Accessible layout semantics

### Developer Experience
- Intuitive composition API
- Predictable responsive behavior
- Type-safe layout properties
- Performance-optimized rendering

The layout system created in Milestone 2 became the foundation for all subsequent UI patterns and enabled rapid development of complex, accessible, and responsive user interfaces.
