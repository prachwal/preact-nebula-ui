# Milestone 5: Technical Overview - Navigation & Data

## Component Architecture
- **Breadcrumb**: List-based, ARIA navigation, responsive collapse
- **Pagination**: Button group, keyboard navigation, jump to page
- **Table**: Column config, sorting, responsive, ARIA roles

## Patterns
- Routing integration for navigation components
- Data-driven rendering for Table
- Accessibility: ARIA, keyboard, focus management
- Performance: Virtualization for large tables (future)

## Testing
- 100% coverage with @testing-library/preact + Vitest
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation tests

## Extensibility
- Custom renderers for Table cells
- Theming for navigation controls
- Integration with data fetching libraries
